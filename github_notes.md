# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** Share files using a cloud-based storage system. Keep backups and storage. 
1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** Forking gets the repository linked to your computer via the cloud. Cloning makes a copy of that forked repository and puts it on your personal computer. 

## What's gone on so far

- I opened this file in a different directory called "delete" and cloned it into that directory. I then connected that file to the github repository. I added some things into this same file, pushed everything to github and then I deleted the folder. I watched those files get crossed out in red on a different vscode window and then I reopened this initial file to find none of those changes. I'm assuming i would have to `git pull` to retrieve those changes and it SEEMS like they're still available on GitHub even though they've been deleted on my local terminal. 

- I'm now going to git add, git commit and git push this to github and I expect it to either line up and keep the old versions or throw errors.
